## 📝 Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map,  
return the volume of water it can trap after raining.  

---

### Example 1:
**Input:**
heightMap = [
[1,4,3,1,3,2],
[3,2,1,3,2,4],
[2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

**Output:**
4

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**
heightMap = [
[12,13,1,12],
[13,4,13,12],
[13,8,10,12],
[12,13,12,12],
[13,13,13,13]
]

**Output:**
14

---

## Constraints
- `m == heightMap.length`  
- `n == heightMap[i].length`  
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`  
- `0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 10^4`
